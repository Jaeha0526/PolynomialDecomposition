# Beam Search Fix Summary

## Problem
The KV-cache optimized beam search (`beam_search_with_cache`) was failing with:
```
RuntimeError: stack expects each tensor to be equal size, but got [1, 37] at entry 0 and [1, 38] at entry 3
```

## Root Cause
Different beam hypotheses can generate sequences of different lengths because:
1. Some beams might hit the END token earlier than others
2. The final tensor stacking operation didn't handle variable-length sequences

## Solution
Your suggestion was correct - the implementation already keeps separate KV-caches for each beam (which is good!). The only issue was the final stacking operation.

### The Fix
Add padding to ensure all sequences have the same length before stacking:

```python
# Instead of:
stacked = torch.stack([beam['sequence'] for beam in beams])

# Do this:
max_length = max(beam['sequence'].size(1) for beam in beams)

padded_sequences = []
for beam in beams:
    seq = beam['sequence']
    if seq.size(1) < max_length:
        # Pad with pad_token if provided, otherwise use 0
        padding_value = pad_token if pad_token is not None else 0
        padding = torch.full((seq.size(0), max_length - seq.size(1)), 
                             padding_value, dtype=seq.dtype, device=seq.device)
        seq = torch.cat([seq, padding], dim=1)
    padded_sequences.append(seq)

stacked = torch.stack(padded_sequences)
```

## Test Results
✅ All tests passed with the fixed implementation:
- Test 1: Input shape [1, 42] → Output shape [3, 60]
- Test 2: Input shape [1, 44] → Output shape [3, 61]
- Test 3: Input shape [1, 46] → Output shape [3, 65]

The fix properly handles different sequence lengths by padding shorter sequences.

## Benefits
1. **Preserves KV-cache optimization** - Each beam still maintains its own cache
2. **Handles variable lengths** - No more tensor size mismatch errors
3. **Maintains performance** - Padding is only done at the very end
4. **Backward compatible** - Same output format as before

## Implementation Notes
- Each beam already maintains its own KV-cache (line 239: cache is cloned for each candidate)
- The fix only changes the final output formatting
- Padding uses the provided `pad_token` or defaults to 0
- The fix is minimal and doesn't affect the core beam search logic

## How to Apply
Apply the patch file `beam_search_fix.patch` to `Training/mingpt/model_kvcache.py`:
```bash
patch Training/mingpt/model_kvcache.py < test/beam_search_fix.patch
```

This will enable beam search to work correctly with Flash Attention + KV-Cache optimizations!
